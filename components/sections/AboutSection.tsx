            <span className="text">My path hasn't been typical. I started as a data engineer helping companies measure their environmental impact through ESG analytics. I built dashboards, ML models, and data infrastructure that powered sustainability at scale.</span>

            <span className="text"> But something was missing.</span>

            <span className="text">My experience working directly with local social organizations still echoed as the most driven I've ever been. I decided I needed to be close to the people creating change. So I spent years facilitating innovation workshops, led social innovation programs, mentored founders, and learned that for tech to be impactful, it didn't need to be complexâ€”it needed to be centered around people. </span>

            <span className="text">Today, I combine both worlds. I help creative entrepreneurs, social ventures, and mission-driven organizations turn ambitious ideas into digital realities. Whether it's prototyping an MVP, building data infrastructure that actually helps make decisions, or facilitating design sprints to craft user experiences. I bring technical experience and creative empathy to every project. </span>

            <span className="text"> I've been pursuing photography and music all my life, and I make them an inherent part of my process, bringing stories and aesthetics to the work.</span>
