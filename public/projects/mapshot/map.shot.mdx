As a traveling photographer, I found myself spending hours on Google
Map, zooming in and out, clicking through village names and points of
interest, desperately searching for inspiring locations.
I wanted a way to filter places by mood, get visual feedback, and hear
from other photographers about their experiences.
That's how MapShot was born: an application designed to help
photographers build an ecosystem of filterable artistic locations.
User can upload photos, vote on moods, reference ideal time, light and
affluence.

Mobile-first full-stack application built with React, TypeScript, and
Next.js, enabling photographers to geotag, catalog, and discover
photo locations combining Mapbox API integration with Cloudinary
for optimized media management.
• Cost-efficient API optimization implemented intelligent resource
loading strategies to minimize Mapbox API calls while maintaining
smooth map interactions, significantly reducing operational costs
without sacrificing user experience.
• Cloudinary integration and optimization engineered efficient
storage solutions and query patterns for photo formats, balancing
image quality with loading performance and storage costs.
• Advanced UI/UX design featuring drawer-based navigation for
intuitive mobile interaction, with a fast-filtering system that delivers
instant results without page reloads, optimizing both user
experience and server costs.
• Clean architecture principles applied Single Responsibility
Principle across components for easy scalability, maintainability, and
rapid debugging, ensuring the codebase remains manageable as
features expand.
• Performance optimization implemented lazy loading, efficient
state management, and resource caching to ensure fast photo
rendering and seamless user interactions across varying network
conditions.
